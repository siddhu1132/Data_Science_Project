SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones.

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.

Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.
